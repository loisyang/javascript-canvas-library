About: 
  This is a fun Google Doodle created by Lois' implementation of HTML <canvas> by javascript.

It consists of three parts: 
  1. "Google" Text with its showdow
  2. A row of six graphics that abstractly represent "Google" as a background
  3. Four spinning animations at each corder of the page
  
Other features:
  1. This is a responsive Google Doodle.

Note:
  - I found Dash (https://kapeli.com/dash) a very useful and powerful tool to quickly check JS/HTML/... APIs.
  - This is a course project for class 05631 SSUI (http://nhahn.org/SSUI-Web-2015/assignments/2015/2015/10/05/p2.html).
  - Hope you will like it!
